- ecg signals from smartwatch are passed to a *siamese network* hosted on <span style="color: #ff9900">aws</span>.
- the network converts the ecg signals to frequency spectrogram and verifies the user.
- ecg is unique for an individual and is very promising for this task.

### predicting the dynamics of tokamak discharge [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06230)] <br> (department of atomic energy, india)
- the aim of the project was to anticipate the phenomenon of major disruption in plasma confinement for *aditya tokamak*.
- we were able to anticipate the disruption of plasma 12 ms prior to the actual disruption (4 ms earlier than the state-of-the-art models).
- input features included the readings of various diagnostics like plasma current, mirnov oscillations, loop voltage, bolo meter readings, and many other.
